  description: The Onboarding API provides standardized mechanisms for managing an
    onboarding process. The API allows the retrieval, creation, update and deletion
    of partnership type and its owned sub- resources.The intention for partner onboarding
    in the Digital Ecosystem is to have a lightweight approach similar to an end-user
    signing-on to terms and conditions for downloadable applications. The onboarding
    of the “Party”, the role can be Partner, Supplier, Developer, etc. The onboarding
    of the “Services”  could be product offerings.
